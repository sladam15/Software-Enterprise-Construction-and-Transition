# SER316 Mascotmon Simulator

Ever wanted to show more support for your favorite team and mascot? Then have no fear because Mascotmon is here! 
This simulator allows mascots to battle each other to see which is the strongest one of all. 
The mascots have a specific type (fire, water, ground, or normal) and three stats that consist of: attack, defense, and health.
The battlefield's weather as well as type advantages may have positive or negative effects on the attack or defense stats of certain types.

The damage formula should be the attacker's attack value * weather and types bonuses - defender's defense * weather and types bonuses.
